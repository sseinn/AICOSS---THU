# Project Management - Why?

- High failure rate of software projects

- Software is non-material product, only the developers can assess the status and quality of the product during the creation process


# Scrum - aigle software project management

- Scrum has been known as an agile software process in software development since the mid-1900s

- After the document-centered and rigid processes of the 1980s(waterfall model, V-model) Scrum is based on the idea of lean product and value creation from the implict knowledge of Japanese corporations(e.g. Toyota)

- Scrum is an alterative to command-and-control organization. Scrum is based on highly qualified, interdiciplinary, development teams that are given a clear objective but are self responsible for its implementation. This allows a team to unleash its creativity and performance and achieve better products.

- Scrum is now used in most national and international companies, but it is not the ideal solution for every project(Certifications require different process, hardware, dependencies are difficult to map, inexpereinced teams, ect.)
