# AICOSS Project : Task Description

- Explorative data analysis + Feature engineering(Ideally already using LLM) + Lead conversion/scoring model(classification)

  - Focous is on the development of a robust model for predictiong lead conversons. A LLM can be used here primarily for feature engineering. The LLM analyses the text data of the leads(such as enquiries, notes, ect.) and extracts relevant features that could be decisive for the probability of conversion(e.g. key points of interest, uregency)
