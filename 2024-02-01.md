# Text Mining


- Term

  Umbrealla term enclosing activities that aim to discover previously unknown information in (mostly) unstructured natural text.

- Unstructured Data

  Text data is the primary example of unstrucured data which adds new challenges to the ML pipeline and the data you have seen so far (e.g., tabular data) -> heavy focus on preprocessing.

- Text Mining Activities

  - Information Retrieval(IR) : Search for relevant information in documents (does not only incoude text). Search for relevant documents itself.
 
  - Natural Language Processing(NLP) : Aims to "understand" text to identify and structure relevant information. Includes the generation of text(e.g., chat bots)
 
  - Data Mining(DM) : Classic approach to discover unknown patterns in structured information.

  # Applications

  - Web-search Engines : Retrieving relevant information from web-pages in responses to text-based user queries
 
  - Intellegent Personal Assistants: Reacting and analyzing natural language requests in order to provide relevant information/answers.
 
  - Machine Translations: Translating texts from one language to another. Aims to maintain the natural flow of the target language instead of purely relying on literal word-by-word translations.
 
  - Spelling Correction
 
  - Topic Detection
 
  - Sentiment Analysis
 
  - Spam Detection
 

# Challenges

- Language Dependency

  - One of the major issue in regars to text mining -> methods/techniques/algorithms almost always have to be altered to accommodate the target language.
 
  - Different meaing of words in different languages : "Brief" -> German? English?
 
- Domain Dependency

  - Texts can have different style, meaning, and purpose in different settings (e.g., leagal texts vs. classic literatue vs. holiday post cards)
 
  - Often domain knowledge and context is needed to properly understand texts.
 
- Ambiguity

  - Quantifiers : "I didn't buy a house"
 
  - Word Sense : "I went to the bank"
 
  - Idioms : "To get cold feet"


# Performace Aims

- Effectiveness

  - Due to mentioned challenges, Text Mining is rarely free of errors.
 
  - Circumventing those challenges in order to maximize effectiveness is a primary goal of any text mining related approach.
 
- Efficiency

  - Text mining often has to deal with huge amounts of data.
 
  - However, especially in practival applications, it is vital to manage available resources carefully and to optimize run-time and strage needs(e.g., response times for intellegent assistants.)
 
- Robustness

  - Text mining often needs to handle texts with unknown properties.
 
  - Techniques and methods related to text mining should be effective across diffenenr domains, genres, and topics.
 

# Classic Text Mining pipeline

1. Gathering DATA/Documents

캐글에 free data source가 많이 있다...



2. Tokenization

3. Lexicon Normalization (Lemmatization & Stemming)

4. Stop Word Removal

5. Vectorization(indexing & Embedding)

6. Modeling / Analyzing
   

- Pipeline Approach

  - Classic and standard approach to tackle text mining problems.
 
  - Sequentially apply a set of text analysis algorithms to the input texts.
